Partial Domain Adaptation
==========================================

We provide benchmarks of different domain adaptation algorithms on `Office-31`_ , `Office-Home`_, `VisDA-2017`_  and  `ImageNet-Caltech`_.
Those domain adaptation algorithms includes:

-  :ref:`DANN`
-  :ref:`PADA`
-  :ref:`IWAN`
-  :ref:`AFN`

.. note::

    - ``Origin`` means the accuracy reported by the original paper.
    - ``Avg`` is the accuracy reported by DALIB.
    - ``Source Only`` refers to the model trained with data from the source domain.

.. note::

    We found that the accuracies of adversarial methods are not stable even after the random seed is fixed, thus
    we repeat running adversarial methods on *Office-31* and *VisDA-2017* for three times and report their average accuracy.
